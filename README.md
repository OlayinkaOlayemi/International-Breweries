# International-Breweries
This is an analysis of the International breweries sales record over a couple of years. Analysis was done using PostgreSQL.
This project was carried out during my time as a student enrolled in the Utiva Data Incubator Program. I must state that it was my first project and introduction to Structed Query Language.
I found the analysis interesting and amazing on how easy it was to draw out valuable insights that could help the organization make quality decisions.
